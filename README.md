### Network Science Repository

**Repository Link**: [GitHub - AlanAmaro13/Network_Science](https://github.com/AlanAmaro13/Network_Science)

**Description**:
This repository provides resources, tools, and theoretical foundations for the study of **network science**, an interdisciplinary field that analyzes the structure and dynamics of networks in various domains, such as social, biological, and communication systems. The repository utilizes a Colaboratory Notebook to explore these concepts practically.

**Key Features**:
- **Core Concepts**: 
  - **Nodes and Edges**: Represent entities and their connections within networks.
  - **Network Types**: Social, biological, communication, and transportation networks.
  - **Graph Theory**: Mathematical tools to study network properties, such as degree, centrality, and connectivity.
  - **Network Properties**: Topology, clustering, and community structure.
  
- **Mathematical Tools**:
  - **Adjacency Matrix**: Used to represent connections between nodes.
  - **Degree Centrality, Closeness, and Betweenness**: Metrics to determine node importance.
  - **PageRank and Katz Centrality**: Additional methods to rank node relevance.

- **Applications**: 
  - Social network analysis, epidemiology, infrastructure optimization, and data science.
  
- **Algorithms**: Community detection, shortest paths, and network robustness analysis.
- **Visualization**: Methods for visually analyzing network structures.

**Key Topics Covered**:
- **Random Networks**: Explores the construction and properties of random networks using binomial and Poisson distributions.
- **Network Centrality**: Various measures of node importance, including degree centrality and PageRank.
- **Modularity and Clustering**: Tools to detect and analyze communities in networks.
  
**References**:
This repository draws from established works in network science, including **A.L. Barab√°si's "Network Science"** and algorithms for community detection developed by Blondel et al.
